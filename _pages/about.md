Results-driven Senior Data Analyst with a strong background in supply chain engineering. I have a proven track record of leveraging Python, R, VBA, and BI tools to deliver high-impact solutions.

I'm passionate about translating complex business needs into data-driven strategies and actionable insights. I thrive in roles where I can combine my technical skills in data analysis and modeling with my deep understanding of business operations to solve challenging problems and drive tangible improvements.

Whether it's automating business processes, optimizing complex workflows, or developing interactive dashboards, my goal is always to use data to tell a story and empower better decision-making.
